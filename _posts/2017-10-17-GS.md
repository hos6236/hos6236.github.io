title: Genomic Selection  (GS)

 "For such a model there is no need to ask the question "Is the model true?". If "truth" is to be the "whole truth" the answer must be "No". The only question of interest is "Is the model illuminating and useful?"

`George Box`. 1976,  Journal of the American Statistical Association
