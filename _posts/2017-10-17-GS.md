title: Genomic Selection  (GS)
---

 "For such a model there is no need to ask the question "Is the model true?". If "truth" is to be the "whole truth" the answer must be "No". The only question of interest is "Is the model illuminating and useful?"

`George Box`. 1976,  Journal of the American Statistical Association

- Rationale

- Statistical models

- Accuracy

- Examples

- Models (BLUP, Bayes...)

- Cross Validation

## Papers for discussion (by Patricio Munoz)

Next Tuesday (October,26th), we will discuss two of the papers sent by Patricio last week (numbers 2 and 3 in the list below). They provide a nice review about factors affecting GS, as well as some real applications. I would like each one of you to bring to class 4-5 bullet points with questions and comments about the paper. 

1. [Prediction of Total Genetic Value Using Genome-Wide Dense Marker Maps](http://www.genetics.org/content/157/4/1819.long)

2. [Genomic selection in dairy cattle: Progress and challenges](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030209703479?via=ihub)
