title: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
---

 "In a period of less than five years, the
GWAS experimental design in human populations has
led to new discoveries about genes and pathways involved
in common diseases and other complex traits, has
provided a wealth of new biological insights, has led to
discoveries with direct clinical utility, and has facilitated
basic research in human genetics and genomics".

`Visscher et al. 2012`-  Am J Hum Genet. 2012 Jan 13; 90(1): 7–24.

## Concepts

- Quantitative trait loci.

- Linkage disequilibrium (LD).

- Single marker regression.

- Multiple testing.

- Missing heritability.

- Population structure.

## Papers for discussion (by Marcio Resende)

Please find attached two papers for discussion next Tuesday (October, 3th). I believe these will re-emphasize and complement nicely a lot of the topics that were discussed so far. Please bring questions to get a nice discussion going and come prepared to explain some of the sections as well. Each student must bring three topic from the papers to be discussed during class.
So, in a piece of paper write your name and the three bullet point you want to discuss (related to the papers) and bring that to the class.

- [10 Years of GWAS Discovery: Biology, Function, and Translation](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929717302409?via%3Dihub)

- [Status and Prospects of Association Mapping in Plants](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/tpg/abstracts/1/1/5)

## PCA analysis (by Felipe Ferrão)
During class, it was brought an interesting discussion about PCA analysis and how we could use this approach to analyze the interrelationships among a large number of variables and, consequently, to correct a possible pattern of population structure. Discussion on PCA analysis, eventually, appears in forums on the internet. A nice (and funny) explanation about PCA and its importance was suggested in the following scenario:  

**Imagine a big family dinner, where everybody starts asking you about PCA. First you explain it to your great-grandmother; then to you grandmother; then to your mother; then to your spouse; finally, to your daughter (who is a mathematician). Each time the next person is less of a layman.** 

[Here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues) is how the conversation might go. The author uses graphs to explain his thoughts. I hope this example can give you an intuitive idea, without entering in many mathematical formalities.
