title: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
---

 " In a period of less than five years, the
GWAS experimental design in human populations has
led to new discoveries about genes and pathways involved
in common diseases and other complex traits, has
provided a wealth of new biological insights, has led to
discoveries with direct clinical utility, and has facilitated
basic research in human genetics and genomicss"
