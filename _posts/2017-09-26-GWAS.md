title: Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS)
---

 "In a period of less than five years, the
GWAS experimental design in human populations has
led to new discoveries about genes and pathways involved
in common diseases and other complex traits, has
provided a wealth of new biological insights, has led to
discoveries with direct clinical utility, and has facilitated
basic research in human genetics and genomics".

## Concepts

- Quantitative trait loci.

- Linkage disequilibrium (LD).

- Single marker regression.

- Multiple testing.

- Missing heritability.

- Population structure.

## Papers for discussion (by Marcio Resende)

Please find attached 2 papers for discussion next Tuesday (October, 3th). I believe these will re-emphasize and complement nicely a lot of the topics that were discussed so far.Please bring questions to get a nice discussion going and come prepared to explain some of the sections as well. 

- [10 Years of GWAS Discovery: Biology, Function, and Translation](https://github.com/hos6236/hos6236.github.io/blob/master/classes/gwas_3.pdf)

- [Status and Prospects of Association Mapping in Plants](https://github.com/hos6236/hos6236.github.io/blob/master/classes/gwas_4.pdf)
